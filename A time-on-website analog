It turns out that you already did a hypothesis test analogous to an A/B test where you are interested in how much time is spent on the website before and after an ad campaign. The frog tongue force (a continuous quantity like time on the website) is an analog. "Before" = Frog A and "after" = Frog B. Let's practice this again with something that actually is a before/after scenario.
